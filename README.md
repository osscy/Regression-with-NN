# Regression-with-NN

Here an Neural Network is trained and used for prediction of wildfires. 
The model is tuned with keras tuner to find the best hyperparameters and an feature selection is used with randomforestregression to find what kind of features potential affect the result the most. 

An simple API with flask is also developed, which can be used to make wildfires prediction with. This was tested with postman. 

MLflow is also exlpored, which shows how to log parameters, experiments etc.
